> An interative typing practice website inspired by the typing legend - monkeytype. Provides customized wrong words recommandation, replay typing record and multiplayer mode.

## Why YOYOMANTYPE?
For zealous typers, the only goal is to enhence both typing speed and accuracy. However, It is hard to find a place where the typers can really find the pain points and learn from it. Most of the time we just keep on repearting the same mistakes over and over again. 

YOYOMANTYPE provides users to practice typing and review the replay as well as your personal typing history. It recommends customized words based on your previous record to better your typing accuracy. Want to practice with your friends? create or join rooms in multiplayer mode to comepte for the crown.
